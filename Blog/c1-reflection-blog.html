    <h2>A few thoughts after watching the video blog Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table </h2>
    <h3>21 August 2018</h3>
    
    I enjoyed this video. Shereefs analogy of students who adopt the restaurant mentality vs kitchen mentality is so relatable and as I look back on my career and studies taken previously, I see how others as well as myself have adopted one or both of these attitudes (dependent on the situation of course). I am relatively new to dev life, so hearing other peoples views and experiences helps build my confidence that I have chosen the right path for my life right now, and others feel the same way I do about the workload and learning environment I am currently a part of. Watching the video I was happy to learn how the method of phased learning has evolved. This is my first experience with this type of study, and although I initially felt a little overwhelmed, making good progress in a self directed way with online support from my fellow students and the staff at EDA has built my confidence and feels very rewarding. I am excited to continue my learning through phase-0 and start looking towards working in groups during bootcamp to share ideas and knowledge.
