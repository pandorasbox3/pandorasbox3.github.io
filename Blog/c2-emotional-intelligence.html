    <b>What learnings did I take from this chapter?</b><br/>
    Reading "Search Inside Yourself" chapter one gave an interesting insight into Emotional Intelligence. Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer define this as "The ability to monitor ones and others feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide ones thinking into actions". Emotional Intelligence is the ability to perceive, evaluate and manage emotions, which should enable three important skill sets: stellar work performance, outstanding leadership and the ability to create the conditions for happiness.<br/>
    <b>How did I find the two minutes of mindfulness</b><br/>
    Funnily enough, this is something I practice anyway, usually in the evenings to help calm my mind. Part of the reason I named my blog "Melancholy Musings of a Sleep Deprived Mind" comes from the severe insomnia I have and my busy imagination, so techniques like this help me centre and quiet the internal monologue in my mind<br/>
