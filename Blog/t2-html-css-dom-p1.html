    <b>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</b><br/>
    The example used by the teachers on Udacity Lesson best describes this. HTML is like the structure of a house, the floor, walls and room layout. CSS would then be the style applied to the house, the colour of the wallpaper, paint and furniture etc. DOM or Document Object Model is like the interactable elements of your house, like the television remote, light switches or house alarm panels.<br/>
    <b>What is meant by boxifying design?</b><br/>
    Boxifying a design is quite literally breaking down a design into boxes. This concept helps a lot to group or section images and information, making it a lot simpler to manipulate and change the design.<br/>
    <b>What is the box model?</b><br/>
    The box model is way of breaking down every element into boxes and consists of margins, borders, padding and the actual content<br/>
