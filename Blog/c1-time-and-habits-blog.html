    <h1>Time and Habits Blog</h1>
    
    <h3>23 August 2018</h3>
<p>
    After reading through the time habit and management resource, here is my blog addressing some questions:
<br/>
    <b>Which timebox habits and techniques did I try?</b><br/>
    For me, the flow (or being in the zone) technique is something I naturally do when approaching new tasks in life. I like total immersion in whatever I am learning, and find if I can not achieve this state of mind then I either do not really enjoy the task or am losing interest if I have already started the task. I have throughout my EDA journey, actually used the pomodoro technique at times without realising it had a name. This is partly due to life distractions, but also is something I tend to do when learning a new skill, using the "break" time to reflect on and absorb any new information I have learned.<br/>
    <b>What did you find interesting?</b><br/>
    I am a knowledge vampire if I am being honest, so I found all of the material very interesting. Its a strange thing reading the material retrospectively to hammering out the tasks. Identifying my learned behaviours and comparing them to new concepts has been a very interesting thing to mull over while having a hot cup of coffee and watching the rain outside.<br/>
    <b>What worked for you?</b><br/>
    At the moment just using the tools I know and are comfortable with are stopping me from panic stressing about falling behind my fellow students, or succumbing to the lingering doubts that I am an imposter, or in over my head.<br/>
    <b>Which will you experiment further with?</b><br/>
    I found the article Seven Counterintuitive Ways to be Insanely Productive quite an interesting read. Although as the title suggests, these concepts are counterintuitive to the way I work naturally. I would like to try out some of the techniques although being a creature of habit could be counterproductive to being counterintuitive (confused... me too lolz).
